# Storj Research
Research and draft specifications for the next iteration of the Storj network.

The goal of RIPS are to allow us to be clear, calculated and transparent with the way in which we conduct research and share our results along the way.

### What is a RIP?
A RIP is the process for conducting research that results in replacing a small or large portion of our protocol.

### How is a RIP different from a SIP?
A SIP is for making small updates and improvements to the existing protocol. A RIP is for changing the protocol and determining the best way in which that should be done.

### What happens to RIP results once the research has been completed?
Depending on the type of research being done, the results would likely end up living in the code repository for which the research was being done.

### What is the correct process to follow to create and begin work on a RIP?
+ Fork the RIP repository
+ Add the spec for the RIP (need more details here)
	+ Clear problem we're trying to solve
	+ Results expected from this RIP
	+ Options that should be considered during research
+ Create a PR
+ Have it peer reviewed
+ If passes review, it gets merged

### What should not go into a RIP commit?
+ Half baked ideas/thoughts
